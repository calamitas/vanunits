We are happy to announce the release of VanUnits, a Units System
for Ruby.

  http://rubyworks.github.com/vanunits

VanUnits is a spin-off of Facets' units.rb, a most excellent SI type
system library by Peter Vanbroekhoven. This library provides a very
robust system for working with SI types and currency values in a
Ruby-esque way. For example:

  10.m / 10.s             #=> 1 m/s
  1.bit/s + 8.bytes/s     #=> 65.0 bit/s
  1.mile.to(feet)         #=> 5280.0 feet
  1.acre.to(yd**2)        #=> 4840.0 yd**2

In addition to the units system itself, VanUnits includes a large
collection of scientific constants, based on the original compilation
by Daniel Carrera and Brian Gough (hats off to you guys!).

Enjoy,

  Peter
