- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: Encapsulates a service for retrieving exchange rates. This is used by Converter.register_currency. An instance of this class behaves like a Numeric when used in calculations. This class is used to look up exchange rates lazily.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: This class is not supposed to be instantiated by itself. Instead a subclass should be created that defines the method <tt>get_rate</tt>. The only subclasses provided are currently XMethods and CachedXMethods.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: To be found automatically from YAML files, exchange services should be located under Units::Converter::ExchangeRate.
